                  TurtleTree Labs is a big-vision, proprietary sustainable food
                  technology venture boldly addressing a multi-billion dollar
                  global dairy market opportunity with the capability to create
                  enormous financial and social value by providing accessible
                  nourishment while staving off the threats of food, economic,
                  and socio-political insecurities.
                </p>
                <h3>About the Company</h3>
                <p>
                  TurtleTree Labs is a Singapore-based startup addressing the
                  value gap created by an insufficient and unsustainable
                  animal-based dairy industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cell-based methods are used to make ‘clean milk’ and cultured
                  byproducts. Founders include alumni of Google, other U.S. and
                  Asian productively disruptive technology ventures, and a
                  leading U.S. traditional dairy.
                </p>
                <h3>Products and Services</h3>
                <p>
                  The company has created patent-protected technologies to make
                  full-composition, full-functionality, full-flavor milk
                  referencing humanely selected dairy cow cells then mimicking
                  the natural process of milk production in the lab, essentially
                  making real milk without the pollution, inefficient use of
                  land, water and energy (natural resources), pathogen and
                  disease risk, and tangled
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-6 col-xl-6 col-12">
                <p>
                  regulatory politics. The product will be 95% less resource
                  consumptive. TurtleTree will own the technologies that make
                  the milk, leveraging and enabling its IP across global regions
                  and manufacturers. Principal revenue streams include
                  licensing, enablement consulting, and royalties. Additional
                  revenue may include branded consumer products distributed
                  regionally by global dairy companies.
                </p>
                <h3>
                  Strategic Considerations
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The company is advantaged by committed support from the
                  various Singapore government agencies, in alignment with
                  Singapore's goals to produce 30% of its own nutritional needs
                  by 2030. The company will first address a propitious market
                  opportunity in Asia, then move into other promising market
                  areas similarly driven by increasing populations seeking
                  better nourishment or encumbered by poor dairy infrastructure
                  and declining environmental quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Licensing the technology to powerful local processors and
                  distributors pierces their hegemonic operating environments
                  and defenses, further building company value.
                </p>
                <p>
                  TurtleTree improves on each key driver—Nutritional value, food
                  safety, convenience.
